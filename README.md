# AmarjitsQuiz
Web API showcasing timed qiuz using JavaScript
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

I wanted to create code for analysing the financial records of a company.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 I wanted to showcase my Javascript skills 
- What problem does it solve?
  * Taking a quiz
  * press the start button and timer starts and a question is presented
  * when the question is answered another question is presented
  * if the question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock
  * if the question is answered correctly another question is presented
  * when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
  * the game is over
  * when the game is over
  * then I can save my initials and score

- What did you learn?
I took the starter code and refactored it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.
